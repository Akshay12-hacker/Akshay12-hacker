# 👋 Hi, I’m Akshay — aka **Zyrus**

🛡️ Cybersecurity Learner | 🧑‍💻 Backend Developer | 🧠 Systems Thinker

## 🎓 About Me

I’m a **B.Tech student at Sage University, Bhopal**, focused on **security-first development**, backend systems, and understanding how software *actually breaks* — not just how to build it.

I don’t chase buzzwords.  
I chase **depth, fundamentals, and real competence**.

## 🔍 What I Actually Do

### 🔐 Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
- Linux (Kali / Ubuntu)
- Networking fundamentals
- Wi-Fi security basics
- OSINT & CTF-style problem solving
- Studying real-world failure points: logic flaws, misconfigs, permissions

### 💻 Backend Development
- Python (primary)
- C (systems-level understanding)
- Node.js for APIs & backend workflows
- Auth systems, controllers, services, role-based access

### 🤖 Automation & Security Tooling
- Practical automation scripts
- Early-stage AI-assisted security workflows  
  *(learning-first, not hype-driven)*

## 🧪 Projects

### 🖧 LAN Chat System
- File transfer
- Active vs disconnected user tracking
- Focus: networking logic & reliability

### 🧠 NeuroSec (Work in Progress)
- AI-assisted cybersecurity helper
- Goal: learning support & analysis  
- **Not** “auto-hacking” nonsense

> I prefer **fewer projects with real depth** over dozens of shallow demos.

## 🎯 Long-Term Direction

- Become a **Security Engineer / Security-focused Developer**
- Strong foundations in:
  - Operating Systems
  - Computer Networks
  - Backend Architecture
- Target organizations: **CrowdStrike** & security-driven companies

No shortcuts. No fake expertise.
